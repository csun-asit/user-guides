## Scanning Documents on the 6515 MFP
-----------------
These instructions were created using the Automatic Document Feeder (ADF) as an example. Using the flatbed is a similar process, except put your documents on the glass in Step 1.


1. Load your documents into the ADF on the top of the printer. Please note that the ADF pulls pages from the top of the stack down, so the first page of your document should be on top of the stack, and the last page on the bottom of the stack. The blue light will illuminate to indicate that documents are in the ADF, and the ADF will rise upward.
