## Updating Your Email Signature
------------------------------
Your email signature is specific to the email application that you use. For example, if you use the desktop version of Microsoft Outlook 2016 (accessed via the Start Menu), then your signature will "live" only in that application. If you were to open Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) through a web browser, then your signature will not be there.

To add or change your signature, follow the appropriate guide below.

*Via Microsoft Outlook 2016 (Desktop Outlook)*

1. Open Outlook and click on the "File" tab.

4. Click on the "Signatures" button.
