**How to Create a Departmental Virtual Office**

The purpose of this documentation is to create a Virtual Departmental Office for users in the department to constantly use for their meetings. One designee (a person) will have to be selected.

If an Alternative Host joins the meeting ("opens" the Virtual Office) before the Main Host, that Alternative Host will join as the Host. However, the Main Host can join the meeting at any time, and only the Main Host has authority to reclaim the position of Host at any time. Only one person can be given the position of Host at any time.

If the Host tries to leave, they will be warned to make someone else the host, otherwise the meeting will end (the Virtual Office will "close") for everyone. Please refer to the instructions found here: http://www.csunas.org/it/Zoom#Giving_Host_Control_to_Someone
