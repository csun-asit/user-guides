## Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
File Browser allows your iPad to connect directly to the X-Drive over WiFi. This gives the capability to copy almost any sort of file, including photos and videos, from your iPad straight to the X-Drive. This document goes over how to do just that, as well as using some of File Browser’s other features.

## Initial Setup
**The steps below are for your reference only. Your IT department will complete this portion.**

##Other Helpful Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section goes over additional features of the File Browser app that we found to be useful.


**Adding a Folder**

A new folder can be created anywhere, same as a regular Windows computer.
1. Open the File Browser app and go to the folder that you want to create a new sub-folder in. Then tap the “+” icon and tap “Add new folder”

	![iPad_26](./images/iPad-26.png)

**Bookmarks**

Bookmarks allow you to “jump” quickly to a specific folder, avoiding the need to tediously tap through several sub-folders.
1. After you’ve signed in, go to the folder that you want to bookmark (the name at the top is the name of the folder that you’re currently in). When you are in the folder that you want to bookmark, tap the “Bookmark” icon to bring up the bookmark menu.

**Refreshing the Camera Roll**

If you take photos with the iPad while still signed into the File Browser app, then the new photos may not appear in the Camera Roll. To have them appear, refresh the folder: (This also works for any folder, not just the Camera Roll. The process is the same.)

1. Open your Camera Roll by tapping Photo Library > Camera Roll. Then tap “Refresh”.

2. Your new photos should now appear.

**Changing the Sort Order and Viewing Options**

By default, the files in a folder are sorted by "date modified", in a "list" format.
To change the sort order of items in a folder, simply tap the “sort” icon” and tap the appropriate options.
